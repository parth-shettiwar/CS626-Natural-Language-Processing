Install the libraries using pip and run the code SVM.py. Alternatively SVM.ipynb file is also uploaded. You can run that code after uploading it on Google Collab.
The output will be calcuated as per-POS accuracies, 5 fold accuracy and a confusion matrix
You can change the number of iterations by changing the "iter" variable. Full training takes almost 2-2.5 hours.
The SVM algo is adopted from paper "Large-scale Multiclass Support Vector Machine Training via Euclidean Projectiononto the Simplex".
