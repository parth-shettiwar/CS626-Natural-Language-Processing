The code runs only on Python 2.7 ( I have used 2.7.17). This is because keras-contrib CRF layer works on python 2.7. 
Download the various libraries mentioned in requirements.txt.
This is the implementation of Conditional Random Fields on CoNLL2000 dataset. The keras-contrib CRF layer is used for the same.
Run the code as python CRF.py. train.txt and text.txt should be present in folder. Additionally I have attached an ipynb file and can be uploaded on collab to run the code. Ensure all the version are correct as mentioned in requirements.txt.
